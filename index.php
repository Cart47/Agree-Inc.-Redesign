            <h2>Why is Mediation Right for You?</h2>
            <p> Conflict inevitably impacts individuals and organizations as they attempt to negotiate the effect of constant change on their lives. Conflict is a form of competitive behavior involving actual or perceived differences in interests or limited resources.</p>
            <p>Conflict, when well managed, is a dynamic catalyst for positive change. When mismanaged it produces hostility, stress and other costs to individuals and organizations. These costs include not just dollars and cents but lost opportunities, damaged or destroyed relationships, low satisfaction and high recurrence levels. In any conflict situation there will always be a "right next step". Effective conflict management leads parties to identify and take that step.</p>
